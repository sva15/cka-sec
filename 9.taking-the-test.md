## 9.2 Exam Clusters

During the exam, each question will ask you to **SSH to a specific machine** to access the cluster.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> - Create a habit of **exiting and returning to the "jump" box** with the `exit` command after completing each task.
> - **Double-check hostnames** before you SSH—copy and paste them.
> - Each host will have different terminal prompts; pay attention to which cluster you're in.
> - You don't want to miss points because you were in the wrong cluster!
